			<h2>Do Cats know their name?</h2>
			<p>It is the opinion of this writer that cats know their name. They don't always respond to it, because they are independant creatures who respond to training in a different way to dogs, but that's OK.</p>
			<p>The important information is that cats do know their names, and will sometimes react when you say their name.</p>

			<h2>Essential tips to raise healthy pets</h2>
			<p>Cats are nocturnal creatures, so they will be active mostly at night. Let them get plenty of rest during the day. They also need access to water. They prefer running water to still water, so a drinking dish with a fountain and filter will encourage them to drink from their designated bowl rather than licking every faucet in the house, or acting like a dog and drinking from the toilet.</p>
			<p>They also need plenty of exercise and a place to sharpen their claws. Unsharpened claws can hurt the cat, so provide a place to do their scratching. If you see them scratching something else, immediately move them to the scratching post and demonstrate with your own hands that this is for scratching.</p>
			<p>Cats have a short memory, so if they do something naughty, stop them immediately. Punishment a few minutes later will be ineffective, because they won't know what you're punishing them for. Also, if you punish them physically, they could become scared of you, so a verbal scolding is best.</p>
			<p>Cats love routines. If you feed them at the same time of day every day, the cat will remember and remind you. Try to keep a routine feeding schedule for a healthy cat.</p>

			<h2>Why does my cat attack me?</h2>
			<p>Any cat owner should know that cats have a hunting instinct. This can be directed into healthy exercise instead of attacking you by providing toys to play with.</p>
			<p>Cats also hold grudges. If you harmed your cat, they could be seeking revenge. Provide safe spaces for them to hide and get adjusted to you before interacting with them too much, and don't be too rough with them.</p>

			<h2>How to throw a birthday party for your cat</h2>
			<p>Cats have no sense of years, or if they do, it's a vague sense of seasons. They do not know when their birthday is. </p>
			<p>If you want to throw a party, do not surprise the cat. Cats do not like surprises. Decorate ahead of time, let the cat get adjusted to the decorations. Get food that the cat can eat and will like.</p>
			<p>If you are inviting guests (and why would you?), invite only a few people that the cat trusts. Do not throw a loud disruptive party that will disturb the cat's routines.</p>
			<p>A good time of day to hold such a birthday party is late in the evening, when the cat is becoming more active.</p>
